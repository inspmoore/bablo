A PWA (Progessive Web App) for your delight. This app will make a tedious process of calculating the arithmetic average of the USD to UAH currency rates from the last three months from the date you choose as simple as pressing a button. Plus there's a two-way calculator to convert both currencies.

## How to use üî®

![bablo in use](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/RashCarefulInvisiblerail-size_restricted.gif)

## Why? üßê

You police?

## How? ‚ú®

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)!

Instead of Redux I've used the new Context API. It worked well for simple tasks like localization. Redux would be much better choice for more complicated tasks, but thanks to small scale of the app, the Context API worked well too.

Besides there's a great [ChartJS](https://chartjs.org) library used for the graph, [momentjs](http://momentjs.com/) to deal with time, [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [react-datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/).

## PWA üöÄ

Thanks to the Service Worker the app works offline, it prompts the user for the installation and caches last results in local storage. It works on iOS 11.3 too, with expception of the install prompt of course.

## Installing üî©

Just clone the repo and then run

```
yarn install
```

or if you stick to raw npm, then

```
npm install

Rest of the scripts are the same as in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#available-scripts) toolbox.
